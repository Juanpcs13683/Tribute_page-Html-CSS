            <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Tejo (Spanish pronunciation: [te.ho]), also known,
             to a lesser degree, as turmequé (pronounced [tuɾ.meke]),
              is a traditional throwing sport in Colombia. 
              It is characteristic for its use of small targets containing gunpowder, 
              which explode on impact.</p>

            <h2>Cultural Background</h2>
            <p>Tejo is a sport that is very popular among the general public. 
                Although there are some Tejo arenas that cater to members of the
                 higher socioeconomic classes, most of them are made and used by 
                 the popular class who consider them to be portraits of their 
                 pre-Columbian origins. Only football has more followers and a
                  developed industry in the country.
